# Lightning Talks

One of the Rust@Wellcome group activities are show-and-tell sessions where a speaker takes 3 to 5 minutes to speak on a personal project, or walk us through their Rust solution to a problem. 

The aim for these talks is to have the focus be on the developer story. 

The rough format would be (1) problem encountered (2) steps taking to solve (3) Rust lessons learned.

These talks can be in or out-of genomics domain and you can use them to solicit collaboration or help.
